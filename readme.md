Build Your Own URL Shortener

process :


    1. iam using sql. i am going to store long url and short url
    2. short url is generated by the " basic 62" algorithm.
    3. if the url prsesnt already -> just print it back
       else make sure u will generate it .


basic -62 algo:
base62Encode takes a number and converts it into a string of characters using numbers (0-9), lowercase letters (a-z), and uppercase letters (A-Z). It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by 62 and using the remainders to pick characters from the base-62 character set.
